            <p>At CryptoChamps, we’ve crafted one of the simplest, most worthwhile bounty programs in the industry to reward our first 500 early community members. We aren’t looking for bug reports or for you to read through tedious posts, register for specific rewards, or invest your valuable time in following pages-long instructions.</p>

            <p>Instead, we’ve decided to trust your judgment and give you the creative freedom to spread the word about CryptoChamps in whatever way you see fit. In return, we pledge to give the first 500 community members rewards valued at over $200,000 in total.</p>
            
            <h4>Here’s how it works:</h4>
            
            <ol>
            <li><p>Create any type of content you want (articles, videos, social media posts, tweets, etc.) to promote CryptoChamps. Write about the program, discuss your experience with CryptoChamps, talk about the contracts you own now or have owned in the past, offer up trading strategies, create tutorials or reviews, or anything else that you think will help promote the program. You can post your content on social media or blogs, contact news organizations, publishers, or magazines to get the content featured, and post about CryptoChamps on reddit, bitcointalk.org, Champ message boards, or anywhere else online. You can even slide on into a Champ’s DMs to let them know about our official contracts program and encourage him or her to sign up.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Submit links and screenshots of your content to us by February 15th. Just shoot us an email at hello@cryptoChamps.co</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Our team will evaluate submissions and rank each on a scale of 1 to 10 based on their value to the program. How we score your submission(s) depends on a few different factors, including:</p></li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>Reach:</strong> How many social media followers you have and how many likes, shares, retweets, and/or views your content achieved.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Quality:</strong> How accurate, well-written, engaging, and informative your content was.
            Effort: The originality and complexity of the content you created. If you planned, shot, and edited a high-quality video promoting CryptoChamps, your submission will have a higher value score than a simple Tweet that achieved the same engagement.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Success:</strong> If your content went viral, your article discussing CryptoChamps was published in a major national newspaper, or you convinced a famous Champ to join our official contracts program, you’re pretty much guaranteed a score of 10.</p>
            
            <p>It’s that simple! But here’s the amazing part – the rewards.</p>
            
            <p>Every Champ has a single, one-of-a-kind, smart contract with a token hard-coded into it that doubles in value with every transaction. Once a new smart contract is released, they tend to get snatched up quickly, causing the value of the token to rise significantly. You’ll receive one or more of these Champ smart contracts based on the value score of your submission to the bounty program and how that score ranks against the value scores of other submissions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Rank 1</strong> receives 1 Champ contract.<br />
            <strong>Rank 2</strong> receives 3 Champ contracts.<br />
            <strong>Rank 3</strong> receives 5 Champ contracts.<br />
            <strong>Ranks 4</strong> receives 5 Champ contracts, with each having an initial value of 0.5 ETH or more!<br />
            <strong>Ranks 5</strong> receives 5 Champ contracts of their choice, as well as 5 more Champ contracts selected by us, with an initial value of 0.5 ETH or more.</p>
