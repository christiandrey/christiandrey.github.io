                            Born on November 1, 1980 to the family of Elias and Christian Ukwuaku, Okwudiri Ukwuaku grew up in Nnewi in Anambra State
                            of Nigeria. He is the third and last child of the family. He was not so lucky to be born with
                            silver spoon in his mouth. His parents struggled as much as they could to ensure the kids had
                            at least two square meal a day. Okwudiri and his siblings assisted in that effort by searching,
                            cracking and eating palm nuts as lunch each day. Sometimes, they would go borrowing food from
                            their neighbors and landlady. Not always lucky in that but they stayed strong and determined
                            to survive. Okwudiri, together with his brother, Uchenna and sister, Ifeyinwa, managed to get
                            admitted to one of the most inferior primary schools at that time. He studied at Nwafor Uruagu
                            Central School, Nnewi. While at Nwafor, he was one of the most brilliant pupils in his class.
                            In his elementary six, for the first time, he saw his teacher weeping. His Dad could not afford
                            to pay for his Common Entrance Exams. His teacher lost a pupil who would have made her proud
                            with the result of the exams. That explained her sorrow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In those days, any pupil who did not take Common Entrance Exam would find it difficult getting admitted to a Government College.
                            As a result, he was admitted to a private commercial college which was very cheap at that time.
                            While in commercial school, he was academically outstanding. He was the Class Prefect from JSS1
                            to SSS1. In his SSS1 Class, he was made the school Associate Editor of the school magazine called
                            The Venture.

                After secondary school, he worked as an Administrative Assistant with Chrisglory Agencies Ltd. He later worked as a teacher
                in Golden Minds Secondary School, Nnewi. From there, he made some savings which would help him pursue tertiary
                education. In 2002, he was admitted to the Department of English in Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka. From
                his freshman to his penultimate year in the university, he was made the Class Representative of his class.
                He held the position for 3 years. At his third year, he participated in a heavily contested Students Association
                presidency and won with a very high margin. He held the position until his final exams in the university.
                Three months after he was admitted to the university, he became the caretaker committee chairman of the newly
                established Nigeria Federation of Catholic Students, Ifite Sub-chapter. A year after, he contested and won
                the presidency of the Association. At the end of his tenure, he was re-elected. In spite of the numerous
                political commitments while at the university, Okwudiri Ukwuaku still made it to Second Class Honours (Upper
                Division) otherwise known as 2.1. He was among the 14 students out of over 250 students in his class who
                got such class of degree. He did his National Youth Service in Babura Secondary School in Jigawa State of
                Nigeria.

            <p>
                In 2015, Okwudiri Ukwuaku traveled abroad for further academic pursuit. He currently has Graduate Certificate in Project
                Management, Graduate Diploma in Project Management and Masters Degree in Project Management, all of which
                are from Curtin University, Australia. He has written and co-authored so many research papers.
