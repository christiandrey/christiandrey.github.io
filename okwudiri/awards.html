                                Okwudiri Ukwuaku has committed and is committing more to humanity. He considers all his humanitarian achievements as an innate passion which characterizes him. It’s his nature. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 1999, he introduced Block Rosary Crusade to his village. That was when he was still in Secondary School. With the little savings he had, he committed all of that to the establishment of the rosary praying group. The Block Rosary Crusade has been there since then.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While in Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka in 2005, as the President of UNIZIK English Students Association, he built a secretariat for the students, a feat that’s still praised and appreciated till today. During his tenure at that time, he rewarded hard working lecturers by giving them merit awards, another achievement that was unprecedented in the university.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Okwudiri Ukwuaku, from 2016, ensured that every person in his village celebrated Christmas in a special way by donating to them several bags of rice and cartons of tomato. In 2017, the same gesture was repeated not only to his village but also to another neighboring village.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 2017, Okwudiri Ukwuaku donated so many bags of rice to widows in 10 villages that make up his town. All the widows in those villages had the best of Christmas in 2017.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 2017, Okwudiri Ukwuaku built a magnificent town hall/civic centre for his village. The village had been without a hall. He built it as a way of unifying the village. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anyone entering Umunachi Owerri Okwe in Onuimo LGA of Imo State, the home of Okwudiri Ukwuaku would be greeted by a gigantic information post. Information is power. It was singlehandedly erected by Okwudiri. A project that cost almost a million Naira.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Okwudiri Ukwuaku, seeing the harsh economic situation of the country that has contributed to the impoverished sick being deprived of adequate medical attention, donated thousands of Naira as trust fund for financial support to anyone who falls sick in his village. Currently, all sick persons in his village are benefiting from that generosity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Okwudiri Ukwuaku has financially helped so many people start their businesses. He has also helped so many people travel abroad in quest of greener pastures.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He has plans to build a skill acquisition centre for Onuimo youths empowerment. In the Skill Acquisition Centre, he plans to introduce teaching and learning of computer programs, web designing and development, project management skills, catering skills, crafts, technical skills, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He plans to extend his Medical Trust Fund to other communities in Onuimo, thereby helping to reduce mortality rate arising from poverty.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He plans to establish an initiative he calls Onuimo Bursary Award (OBA) where eligible Onuimo students will receive financial assistance for their tertiary academic pursuits.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He is also looking forward to attracting multinational companies to Onuimo in order to create employment and help in alleviating economic hardship in Onuimo.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The affairs of Onuimo are the passions that weigh heavy on Okwudiri’s shoulder. He delights in seeing his people happy and he is out to make things easy for them. By the Grace of God Almighty, he is unwilling to give up on this mission no matter how long it takes him to get it done.
