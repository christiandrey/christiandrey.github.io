                    <p>Here’s how it works. After joining your level 1 upline’s referral link, you pay your upline 0.03btc per month to be in a position to receive the same from each of your level 1 downlines. This is followed by receiving the same amount from each of the two people you recruited. This initiates a chain such that with enough collection of funds from your level 1 downline you get to upgrade to level 2 in the same manner you joined. This process keeps expanding and helps you gain enough money in a convenient way.</p>

                    <p>MONEMATE was born out of the frustrations experienced with two other similar systems. We looked critically at the current models and wanted to fix the issues that plagued those systems to create a system that would benefit our members. The shortcomings of the other two systems and the frustrations it caused to members as well as the admins of those programs necessitated a revolutionary rethink of the system that removes all those issues that keep people from benefiting from the system as they should.</p>
                    <p>No more waiting for confirmations.</p>
                    <p>No more waiting for transactions to be confirmed between banks  and the delays with it.</p>
                    <p>No more submitting of proof of payments.</p>
                    <p>No more fake transactions and fake POPs.</p>
