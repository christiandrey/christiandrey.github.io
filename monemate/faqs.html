                <h6 class="faq faq-question">What is MONEMATE?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">MONEMATE is a Subscription Service where members make a contribution  and raise funds for various causes, whether it is for personal needs or a host of worthy causes, such as churches, schools, non-profit organizations, etc.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">How does MONEMATE work?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">When you join MONEMATE you join a community of like-minded members who are interested in subscribing to valuable content and services. Our subscription membership is private and you can only join by being invited through a member's subscribe link.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">Is MONEMATE available worldwide?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">Yes, MONEMATE is available to anyone with an internet connection, a Bitcoin wallet and the willingness to become a member.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">What payment processors are used?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">We only use Bitcoin to make it easy for members to pay for their subscriptions.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">Can I have more than one account?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">Yes you can have more than one account.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">Are there any refunds?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">All subscription payments happen between members and it is up to members to reach an agreement amongst themselves if they allow refunds or not.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">I don't have a bitcoin wallet where do I go to open a bitcoin wallet?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">The only places we highly recommend you go get a Bitcoin wallet is at <a href="https://blockchain.info/wallet/" target="_blank">https://blockchain.info/wallet/</a> or <a href="https://www.coinbase.com" target="_blank">https://www.coinbase.com</a></p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">What does the "due date" mean in the back office?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">It is the date your next subscription payment for that level is due.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">Do we only upgrade to the next level after 180Days?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">You should upgrade to the next level the moment you are able to, so that you don't miss out on subscription payments coming to you for those levels.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">Are you allowed to upgrade even though your level is not filled up eg to be on level 1 you must have 2 downline, does that mean you have to get exactly 2 before upgrading to level 2?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">You can upgrade at any time, the sooner you are able to. The sooner you know you will not miss out on any subscription payments.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">Is it possible for downlines to upgrade to your upline instead of you if you're not on that level yet?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">Everyone can have their own unique experience in the system. It is best to upgrade the moment you are able to. If you don't you will miss subscriptions for the levels you have not upgraded to if there are members below you on those levels who upgrade fast.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">Isn't this like a pyramid scheme?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">Well a pyramid scheme means that only the top members of the hierarchy get paid whereas MONEMATE allows every member to earn the same amount by doing the same amount of work. You can receive more subscriptions than the person who signed you up.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">Do we have to pay the 0.0005 btc Subscription in 180 Days?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">Yes, you started a 180 days subscription for each level. If you want to continue to receive subscriptions from each level you need to pay your subscription every 180 days for each level to qualify.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">When using the hash id to submit proof of donation the system says Hash ID already used?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">It may happen that you selected the wrong Hash ID when you upgraded or that you did not follow the safe rule of only using blockchain.info to make you subcription payments in the program.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">Can I use the same IP address to help my team to open accounts for multiple people?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">Yes you may as long as you don't stack accounts.</p>
                <h6 class="faq faq-question">What happens if I don't pay my subscription?</h6>
                <p class="faq faq-answer">If your subscriptions are in arrears, for any level that you have upgraded to, then the subscriptions that would have come to you, for that particular level, will bypass you and go up to your level 1 upline, if they are qualified. For example: If someone on your level 2, in your matrix, is either upgrading to level 2 or is paying their subscription for level 2, if you are qualified, you will receive that subscription payment. If you are not yet on level 2 or you are in arrears on your level 2 subscription, the subscription payment will bypass you and go to your level 1 upline, if they are qualified to receive a level 2 subscription payment, meaning they are already on level 2 and they are current with their level 2 monthly subscriptions. It works the same way with the regular upgrades and the subscriptions... so don't get skipped!</p>
