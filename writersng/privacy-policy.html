                <p>
                    We are always ready to revise your paper if it does not entirely meet your expectations. We will revise your paper at no cost if your request is in line with our terms:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Your revision directions should <strong>remain the same </strong>and not conflict with your initial specifications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You must submit your <strong>request for revision using the request revision button </strong>on your personal order page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can request a revision at any time before approving your order, but you have <strong>only 7 days after the order has been approved</strong> to request a revision.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    If you require significant changes to the original order or request a revision 7 days after an order has been approved, you will have to pay an extra fee. Contact our admin for an estimate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For orders with the Progressive Delivery feature <em>(longer than 20pages and delivered in batches as agreed upon by writer and customer-</em> (most frequently full Thesis or Dissertation orders) the deadline for a revision request is limited to 21 days after initial approval.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that we hold the rights to extend the deadline for revision as per the writer’s request in cases where the delivery time frame you have initially paid for allows such extension.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When requesting a different writer, please remember that additional time is needed to find a new writer, so make sure you adjust your revision deadline accordingly. We suggest you add an extra 24 hours to the initial deadline for the new writer.

                    Payment Policy
                </h5>
                <p>
                    In order for your order to be processed and the project to be begun, We require a full deposit upfront. This policy applies to new clients and their initial orders as well as ongoing clients who work with Writers.ng on a retainer basis. Your project details will not be passed onto the writer and work will not commence until we are able to verify that we have received proper payment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will be immediately notified if payment is needed in order to begin your order. If the payment is not made within <strong>seven (7) days</strong> of the notification, we will assume that you no longer are interested in having the content written and cancel the request along with any project details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a customer desires to cancel an order, this must be done with a written notice within <strong>48 hours</strong> days of placing the order. The customer will still be held liable for the payment of any expense that was incurred and/or any product which is already completed. This will be based on a percentage of the order completed. Customers may not attempt to cancel an order once it has been completed and will be responsible for the full agreed payment amount.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If at any time a client wishes to pay bonus money to a writer for an exemplary job, this should be done alongside the regular payments. Writers.ng will then distribute 75% of that bonus to the appropriate writer, retaining 25% to be distributed to the editors and management.
                </p>

                    Customer’s requests for refunds will be treated as a revision, and our team will work to revise the content to your satisfaction. Customers agree that it is their responsibility to provide us with the correct information and specification/direction in order to ensure that the content ordered is always received to your satisfaction. Although as a general rule, we don’t offer refunds due to the time and effort taken by our writers to deliver content, we will make every effort in our power to correct a customer’s project if you are not satisfied.

If after three (3) days we do not receive a response from you, it will be our assumption that you are satisfied with the work done and will tag the order as completed.
